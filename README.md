# ⚙️ Alae Eddine Jahid — Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my personalized developer portfolio — a clean, structured, and responsive website showcasing who I am, what I build, and how I think.

> Designed with intention, engineered with clarity, and structured to scale.

---

## 📄 Overview

This portfolio reflects my developer identity — built using a base template, but **refactored** to fit my standards. I focused on structured thinking, clarity of purpose, and frontend architecture inspired by Atomic Design.

🧠 **Note:** The primary focus of this project is not on visual design or content, but on the **clean, scalable file structure and architecture**. It's meant to reflect professional frontend habits — not just presentation.

---

## 💡 Features

- Modular codebase using **.tsx**, **.styles.ts**, and **.types.ts** conventions
- **Atomic Design** system: atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → views
- Fully **responsive** layout, optimized for both desktop and mobile
- Organized project sections with GitHub source code links

---

## 📚 Tech Stack

- **Framework:** React (with Vite)
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Styling:** styled-components
- **Routing:** React Router
